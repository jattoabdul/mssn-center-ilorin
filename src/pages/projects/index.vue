        The aspiration for a centre of this kind has been nurtured by the
        National leadership of the society for over four decades when the land
        was donated to the society and secured by its donors and promoters.
        Unfortunately, this aspiration has not been realised due to a myriad of
        challenges that has hindered its actualisation. These challenges range
        from illegal encroachments on the land site for the proposed project; to
        inaccessibility of funds for the implementation of the project. These
        challenges and consequent neglect of the site over the years has
        occasioned the dilapidation of the structure that is currently on the
        land which itself was the donation of a philanthropist several years
        ago.

      <p class="wrapper mx-auto my-10 text-xl">
        We accordingly call on members of the Muslim Ummah in all nations of
        world to engage in this Sadaqatul jariyah (everlasting charity) by
        contributing towards this great project for the enhancement of the
        Muslim Ummah.
